# Flutter Groq AI sample

A Flutter chat application that uses the `groq` package.

## Getting started

To use the Groq API, you'll need an API key. If you don't already have one, 
create a key in GroqCloud: https://console.groq.com/playground.

When running the app, include your API key using the `--dart-define` flag:

```bash
flutter run --dart-define=groqApiKey='Your Api Key'
```

If you use VSCode, you can [specify `--dart-define`
variables](https://dartcode.org/docs/using-dart-define-in-flutter/) in your
launch.json file.

If you use Android Studio or IntelliJ you can use run / debug configurations
(https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/run-debug-configuration.html).
